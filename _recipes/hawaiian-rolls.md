title:  "Hawaiian Rolls"
image: hawaiian-rolls.webp
tags: sides, bread

ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons warm water (just barely warm to the touch, like a baby's bath)
- 1 tablespoon active dry yeast*
- 3/4 cup pineapple juice
- 1/3 cup dark brown sugar (firmly packed)
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted
- 2 eggs (large)
- 1 egg yolk (large)
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (approx., you may need a little less or a little more)
- soft butter (to brush on after baking)

directions:
- Stir the warm water and yeast together in a large mixing bowl, then set aside until foamy (about 10 minutes).
- Add the pineapple juice, brown sugar, melted butter, eggs, egg yolk, salt, and vanilla and whisk to combine.
- Stir in the flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, until a stiff dough forms and pulls away cleanly from the sides of the bowl.
- Knead the dough until it passes the windowpane test,** (about 10 to 15 minutes).
- Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and allow it to rise in a warm place until doubled in volume (about 1 hour).
- Punch down the dough and divide it into 15 equal portions (about 65 grams each).
- Shape the rolls and place them in a 9x13-inch greased baking dish that's been lined with parchment paper.
- Cover the rolls with a sheet of greased plastic wrap (if making overnight rolls, place them in the refrigerator for up to 48 hours).
- Allow the rolls to rise in a warm place (if making overnight rolls, remove them from the refrigerator and allow them to come to room temperature first) until doubled in volume (about 1 hour).
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
- Bake the Hawaiian rolls until puffed and golden brown, about 20 to 25 minutes.
- Remove from the oven and brush the tops with soft butter.

*Instant yeast may be substituted.  Rise time may need to be reduced by 10 to 15 minutes.  You'll know your dough is done rising when it has doubled in volume.

**Windowpane test: Pinch off a small piece of dough and stretch it gently from the center outward, with your fingertips.  If it tears, keep kneading.  It should stretch tissue-thin and you should be able to see the light pass through it, like a window.
