ingredients:
- 2 onions
- Big handfull of veg. (I like butternut squash (or anything you like))
- 1/2 cup butter
- 12ish dried apricots
- 600g meat (I use whatever is on hand...)
- 1 cup of flour
- Big pinch of salt and pepper
- 1/4 cup nuts (I like pecans... any kind 'll do)
- Enough couscous

directions:
- Hit the meat with that flour and get it browned a bitin a hot pan with the butter.
- Toss the meat in a bowl or something. Then slice one of the onions and put the slices on the bottom of the tajine.
- Once browned get them on top of the onions in the tajine and pile'em up good in the middle.
- Cut up, slice and dice or puree the rest of the onions and get them in a hot pan with all of the spices. Add spices and stuff to taste.
- Heat until the onion starts sweating and absorbing the spices. you'll know when it's right, if you don't try again.
- Pour the mixture over the meat. Enjoy this moment of near ultimate scent release.
- Stack up veg on top and around the meat. Put on lid of tajine.
- Put the tajine in an oven that is not pre-heated! You'll break the basterd!
- Get the oven to 160ish degrees celcius and wait 2 to 3 hours.
- Trust yourself and do not check... It 'll be right.
- Just before serving prepare the couscous the way you like it.
